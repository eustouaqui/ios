# Render Deployment Verification

This document confirms that your backend has been successfully deployed to Render.com and is properly configured.

## ðŸŽ¯ Deployment Details

- **Render URL**: https://ios-hm94.onrender.com
- **API Base URL**: https://ios-hm94.onrender.com/api
- **Deployment Status**: âœ… Successful

## ðŸ§ª Endpoint Verification

All critical endpoints are functioning correctly:

### Health Endpoints
- `GET /health` - âœ… Returns "OK" (Status: 200)
- `GET /api/health` - âœ… Returns JSON health status (Status: 200)

### API Health Response
```json
{
  "status": "OK",
  "environment": "production, PORT=10000",
  "database": "Connected",
  "timestamp": "2025-09-30T22:03:49.719Z"
}
```

## ðŸ“± iOS App Configuration

The iOS app has been updated to use your Render deployment:

### Constants.swift
```swift
#if DEBUG
static let apiBaseURL = "http://localhost:5000/api" // Development URL
#else
static let apiBaseURL = "https://ios-hm94.onrender.com/api" // Production URL
#endif
```

This configuration ensures:
- **Development**: Uses localhost when running in Debug mode
- **Production**: Uses your Render URL when running in Release mode

## ðŸ”§ Verification Steps Completed

1. âœ… Updated iOS app Constants.swift with Render URL
2. âœ… Verified APIService uses Constants.apiBaseURL
3. âœ… Tested Render endpoints:
   - Basic health check: https://ios-hm94.onrender.com/health
   - API health check: https://ios-hm94.onrender.com/api/health
4. âœ… Confirmed database connectivity
5. âœ… Created test script for ongoing verification

## ðŸš€ Next Steps

Your iOS app is now ready to connect to the production backend. To test:

1. Build and run the iOS app in Release configuration
2. Test core functionality:
   - User registration
   - User login
