   - Add proper error handling for network requests

2. **Enhanced Features**
   - Audio playback functionality
   - History of generated affirmations
   - Sharing capabilities
   - Dark mode support

3. **Testing**
   - Unit tests for data models
   - UI tests for form navigation
   - Integration tests with backend

## Conclusion

The native iOS implementation successfully replicates all functionality of the web-based affirmation form while providing a native iOS user experience. The multi-step form approach, data collection features, and subscription validation have all been implemented using SwiftUI best practices.

Users can now access the personalized affirmation generator directly from the iOS app with the same premium-only access control as the web version.
