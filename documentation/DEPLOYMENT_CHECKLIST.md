- [ ] API health endpoint accessible: https://ios-hm94.onrender.com/api/health
- [ ] Database connection successful
- [ ] All API endpoints responsive

### iOS App Testing
- [ ] App builds and runs in simulator
- [ ] App builds and runs on physical device
- [ ] Affirmation form navigation works
- [ ] Data submission to backend successful
- [ ] Subscription flow functional
- [ ] Error handling works correctly

### Data Flow Testing
- [ ] User registration saves to database
- [ ] Profile data saves to database
- [ ] Goals data saves to database
- [ ] Preferences data saves to database
- [ ] Affirmations save to database
- [ ] Data retrieval works correctly

### Integration Testing
- [ ] End-to-end user flow successful
- [ ] Data consistency between app and database
- [ ] Error states handled gracefully
- [ ] Performance meets expectations

## üîß How to Test Each Component

### 1. Backend Testing

Run from the backend directory:
```bash
npm run test-connectivity
npm run test-render
npm run test-functionality
```

Or manually test endpoints:
1. Open browser to https://ios-hm94.onrender.com/health
2. Open browser to https://ios-hm94.onrender.com/api/health
3. Check Render dashboard for service status

### 2. iOS App Testing

1. Open iOS project in Xcode
2. Select simulator or device
3. Build and run app
4. Navigate through affirmation form
5. Check console for network requests
6. Verify no errors in Xcode console

### 3. Database Verification

1. Log in to MongoDB Atlas
2. Navigate to your cluster
3. Check collections for test data:
   - `users` collection
   - `profiles` collection
   - `goals` collection
   - `preferences` collection
   - `affirmations` collection

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Issues and Solutions

### Render Service Sleeping
**Issue**: Free Render services sleep after 15 minutes of inactivity
**Solution**: 
1. Make a request to wake the service: https://ios-hm94.onrender.com/health
2. Wait 1-2 minutes for service to start
3. Proceed with testing

### Database Connection Issues
**Issue**: Cannot connect to MongoDB Atlas
**Solutions**:
1. Verify IP whitelisting includes Render IPs
2. Check MongoDB Atlas cluster status
3. Confirm connection string is correct
4. Verify database user credentials

### iOS App Connection Issues
**Issue**: App cannot communicate with backend
**Solutions**:
1. Verify Constants.swift has correct URL
2. Check network connectivity
3. Ensure app is built in Debug mode for testing
4. Check for App Transport Security issues

## üìä Success Verification

### Backend Success Indicators
- Health endpoints return status "OK"
- Database shows as "Connected"
- API endpoints respond with 200 status codes
- No errors in Render logs

### iOS App Success Indicators
- App launches without crashes
- All form steps navigate correctly
- Data submission shows success
- No network errors in console
- UI displays properly

### Data Success Indicators
- MongoDB collections contain test data
- Data structure matches expected format
- No missing or corrupted fields
- Timestamps are properly recorded

## üöÄ Next Steps After Successful Testing

### Pre-Launch
- [ ] Set up external pinging to prevent service suspension
- [ ] Configure monitoring and alerting
- [ ] Prepare App Store submission materials
- [ ] Create user documentation

### Post-Launch
- [ ] Monitor service performance
- [ ] Gather user feedback
- [ ] Plan feature enhancements
- [ ] Set up analytics
