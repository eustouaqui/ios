## üéØ How to Implement Secure IP Whitelisting

### Step 1: Get Render Outbound IP Addresses
1. Open the [Render Dashboard](https://dashboard.render.com)
2. Click on your service to open its details page
3. Click the "Connect" button in the upper right
4. Switch to the "Outbound" tab
5. Copy the list of IP addresses shown

**Current Render Outbound IP Addresses:**
- 44.229.227.142
- 54.188.71.94
- 52.13.128.108
- 74.220.48.0/24
- 74.220.56.0/24

### Step 2: Add IP Addresses to MongoDB Atlas
1. Log in to [MongoDB Atlas](https://cloud.mongodb.com)
2. Select your project
3. Navigate to "Network Access" under the "Security" section
4. Click "Add IP Address"
5. For each IP address from Render:
   - Click "Add Another IP Address"
   - Enter the IP address from Render's outbound list
   - Add a descriptive comment
   - Click "Confirm"

For the CIDR ranges (74.220.48.0/24 and 74.220.56.0/24), you can enter them directly as they are in CIDR notation.

### Step 3: Redeploy Your Application
1. Wait 2-5 minutes for changes to propagate
2. Trigger a redeploy on Render:
   ```bash
   git commit --allow-empty -m "Trigger redeploy"
   git push origin main
   ```

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Benefits

By implementing specific IP whitelisting instead of `0.0.0.0/0`:

1. **Reduced Attack Surface**: Only Render's IP addresses can access your database
2. **Compliance**: Meets security requirements for production environments
3. **Control**: You have explicit control over which IPs can access your database
4. **Monitoring**: Easier to monitor and audit database access

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

### IP Address Changes
- Render will update their outbound IP ranges on October 27, 2025
- You'll need to add the new IP ranges to your MongoDB Atlas access rules
- Don't remove the original IPs until after December 1, 2025

### Workspace Creation Date
- If you created your Render workspace before January 23, 2022:
  - Services in the Oregon region do not use fixed outbound IP addresses
  - Consider creating a new workspace or using a static IP provider
